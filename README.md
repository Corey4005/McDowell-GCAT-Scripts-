# Introduction
Scripts developed in this repository will be used with [Jonathan Mcdowels General Catalog of Space Objects (GCAT)](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/). I will keep the functions simple so that they can be used for general analysis and answer similar research questions that may have different parameters in the dataset.

# New Function - 12/7/2021 
* [Link to Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Corey4005/McDowell-GCAT-Scripts-/blob/main/Analysis_1.ipynb) investigating new function on the following research question:
* Question - How many satellite launches have been owned by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as reported by GCAT throughout time? 
* Data - Main catalogs satcat (Standard) TSV file can be downloaded [here](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/tsv/cat/satcat.tsv)

## Task List
* [x] initialized repo
* [x] finished SAT_COUNT_FUNCTION
* [ ] update SAT_COUNT_FUNCTION to add multiple owners when you would like to pass a list instead of string.
