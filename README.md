# Introduction
Scripts developed in this repository will be used with [Jonathan Mcdowels General Catalog of Space Objects](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/). I will keep the functions simple so that they can be used for general analysis and answer similar research questions that may have different parameters in the dataset.
